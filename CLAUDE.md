# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Python Environment
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run Flask server: `python flask_server.py`
- Direct pipeline test: `python Animalchannel.py` (requires environment setup)

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with these required variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for story generation and DALL-E image generation
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token for approval workflow
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Telegram chat ID for notifications
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`: Google Sheets ID for story tracking
- `CLOUDINARY_PRESET`: Cloudinary preset for image uploads
- `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Cloudinary URL for image hosting
- `HAILUO_AUTH`: Hailuo API authentication for video generation
- `KLING_API_KEY`: Kling API key for video generation
- `USE_GOOGLE_AUTH`: Set to "true" to enable Google Sheets integration
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL for Flask-SSE (optional, falls back to in-memory)

### Service Account
Place Google service account JSON at `/etc/secrets/service-account.json` for Google Sheets integration.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Flask Server (`flask_server.py`)**
- REST API endpoints:
  - `/submit`: Generates and returns 20 story scenes (no image generation)
  - `/approve_scenes`: Starts background image generation process
  - `/stream`: Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time image updates
  - `/health`: Health check endpoint
  - `/story/<story_id>`: Polling endpoint for SSE fallback
- Session management via in-memory `active_stories` dict
- Uses multiprocessing for background story generation
- Flask-SSE with Redis support or in-memory fallback

**Story Generation Pipeline (`Animalchannel.py`)**
- Main functions: `process_story_generation()` and `process_story_generation_with_scenes()`
- Flow: Quiz answers â†’ System prompt â†’ OpenAI 20-scene generation â†’ Visual prompt creation â†’ Prompt standardization â†’ Async DALL-E image generation â†’ Cloudinary upload
- Optional integrations: Telegram approval, Google Sheets tracking, video generation (Kling/Hailuo)
- Comprehensive logging throughout pipeline for debugging
- Async image generation using httpx for improved performance

**Frontend (`index.html`)**
- Single-page application with branching quiz logic
- Real-time image display with SSE connections and polling fallback
- 20 editable scene text boxes with auto-resize functionality
- Event handling for `image_ready`, `story_complete`, and `story_error`
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism for connection resilience

### Data Flow
1. User completes quiz in `index.html`
2. Form data sent to Flask `/submit` endpoint, returns generated scenes
3. Frontend displays scenes in editable text boxes with auto-resize
4. User modifies scenes and clicks "Approve Scenes" button
5. Approved scenes sent to `/approve_scenes`, returns `story_id`
6. Frontend opens SSE connection to `/stream?channel={story_id}`
7. Flask server launches multiprocessing `process_story_generation_with_scenes()`
8. Background process: Scenes â†’ Visual prompts â†’ Standardization â†’ Async DALL-E generation â†’ Cloudinary upload
9. SSE events emitted for each completed image with real-time updates
10. Frontend updates image grid in real-time or falls back to polling
11. Optional: Telegram approval and Google Sheets tracking
12. Optional: Final video generation via Kling/Hailuo APIs

### Key Integration Points
- **OpenAI**: Scene generation (GPT), visual prompt creation, image generation (DALL-E 3)
- **Cloudinary**: Image hosting and URL generation for frontend display
- **Flask-SSE + Redis**: Real-time event streaming with fallback to in-memory
- **Telegram**: Optional approval workflow for generated images
- **Google Sheets**: Optional prompt storage and progress tracking
- **Kling/Hailuo**: Optional video generation from final image sets

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Comprehensive logging throughout all pipeline stages
- Graceful fallback for optional services (Telegram, Google Sheets)
- SSE with exponential backoff retry and polling fallback
- Async image generation with proper error handling
- Environment variable validation with warnings
- Multiprocessing isolation prevents main server crashes

## Development Notes

### Story Structure Format
Stories follow a strict 20-scene "Power Fantasy" narrative:
- Scenes 1â€“4: Underdog setup (rejection, sadness)
- Scenes 5â€“6: Discovery of something powerful
- Scenes 7â€“8: First failure or obstacle
- Scenes 9â€“10: Training/building montage
- Scenes 11â€“12: Transformation
- Scenes 13â€“14: Power display
- Scenes 15â€“19: Challenge, justice, redemption
- Scene 20: Closing triumph and symbolism

### Critical Functions

**Flask Server (`flask_server.py`):**
- `emit_image_event()`: Publishes SSE events for real-time updates
- `send_heartbeat()`: Maintains SSE connection with periodic pings
- Session tracking via `active_stories` dict with `story_id` keys

**Story Pipeline (`Animalchannel.py`):**
- `generate_story()`: Creates 20 scenes from quiz answers via OpenAI
- `create_prompts()`: Converts scenes to detailed visual prompts
- `standardize_prompts()`: Ensures visual consistency across prompts
- `generate_async()`: Async DALL-E image generation using httpx
- `process_image()`: Orchestrates generation â†’ upload â†’ approval flow

**Frontend Event System:**
- SSE connection with exponential backoff (1s, 3s, 5s delays, max 3 retries)
- Polling fallback when SSE fails (5-second intervals)
- Auto-resize textareas with scroll support for long content

- Real-time frontend updates via SSE with polling fallback

**Status**: âœ… **Production Ready** - All blocking issues resolved, images should generate fully and display reliably

###
Goals: (remove each goal when completed)
Phase 1: Isolation and Diagnosis (Goals 1-2)
These add targeted logging/tests to confirm the exact failure points without changing logic yet.
Goal 1: Add Diagnostic Logging to Isolate Crash Points
Objective: Insert detailed, conditional logging in key areas (e.g., process_image, Telegram calls, SSE emits) to pinpoint why images aren't completing/generating SSE events.
Rationale: Your logs show crashes in Telegram during image approval, halting after scene 1-2. This prevents full generation and SSE, so frontend shows nothing. Logging will confirm if/where it fails without fixes yet.
Files to Edit: Animalchannel.py, flask_server.py
Key Instructions:
In Animalchannel.py (around line ~430, in process_image): Add logs before/after each major step (e.g., before generate_image: logger.debug(f"Starting generation for {classifier} with prompt length {len(prompt)}"); after upload: logger.info(f"Image {classifier} uploaded, proceeding to approval"); before telegram_approve: logger.debug(f"Calling Telegram for {classifier}, caption length: {len(f'Prompt {classifier}: {prompt}')}"); after approval: logger.info(f"Approval result for {classifier}: approved")).
If rejection: Log logger.warning(f"Rejection {rejection_attempt} for {classifier}, retrying with new prompt length {len(prompt)}").
In flask_server.py (emit_image_event, around line ~40): Add logger.debug(f"Attempting SSE emit for story {story_id}, scene {scene_number}, URL length {len(image_url)}") before sse.publish, and logger.info(f"SSE emit success for {scene_number}") after.
Enable debug level temporarily: Change logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) to level=logging.DEBUG in both files.
Success Criteria: Submit a storyâ€”logs now show exact step/failure (e.g., "Calling Telegram... caption length: 1500" before crash). Confirm halt after scene 1, no "SSE emit success" for later scenes. No new crashes from logging.
Debug Tips: Run with python flask_server.py and watch console. Use grep "Telegram" animalchannel.log to isolate approval logs. If no logs after upload, issue is in generation/upload.
Goal 2: Create Isolated Test Scripts for Image Generation
Objective: Build standalone test scripts to reproduce/isolate image generation outside the full app, confirming if DALL-E/upload/SSE work independently.
Rationale: The crash is in the integrated flowâ€”testing isolation helps verify if the problem is Telegram-specific or deeper (e.g., prompt length in DALL-E). This pinpoints without running the whole server.
Files to Edit: New files: test_image_gen.py (in root), test_sse_emit.py (in root).
Key Instructions:
Create test_image_gen.py: Import necessary from Animalchannel.py (e.g., generate_image, upload_image). Define a test function: Take a sample prompt, call generate_image, upload, log URL. Run with a short prompt (e.g., "red fox") and a long one (>1024 chars) to test length issues. Add: if __name__ == "__main__": test_prompt = "short prompt"; url = upload_image(generate_image(test_prompt)); logger.info(url).
Create test_sse_emit.py: Import from flask_server.py (e.g., emit_image_event). Mock story_id/scene/url, call emit_image_event, check if it logs "SSE Event emitted successfully" (run in isolation: if __name__ == "__main__": emit_image_event("test_id", 1, "fake_url")).
No changes to existing filesâ€” these are new tests.
Success Criteria: Run python test_image_gen.pyâ€”generates/uploads image URL in logs for short prompt; may fail on long (confirms length issue). Run python test_sse_emit.pyâ€”logs emit success (if not, SSE config problem). This isolates if generation works without Telegram.
Debug Tips: Compare test logs to app logs. If tests pass but app fails, issue is in process_image integration.
Phase 2: Core Fixes for Image Generation (Goals 3-5)
Apply fixes based on diagnosis, focusing on removal and simplification.
Goal 3: Fully Remove Telegram and Simplify process_image
Objective: Completely excise Telegram to eliminate crashes (e.g., caption length), and streamline process_image to generate/upload/emit without loops or approvals.
Rationale: Diagnosis (from Goal 1) will show Telegram as the blockerâ€”removing it lets all 20 images complete and emit SSE, fixing frontend display.
Files to Edit: Animalchannel.py
Key Instructions:
Delete all Telegram code: Imports (lines ~14-15), bot init/globals/handlers ( ~50-120), telegram_approve functions ( ~370-400), reject_fix ( ~405-430).
Simplify process_image (now ~370 after deletions): Remove while loop/rejections. Structure: logger.info start, try: img_data = generate_image(prompt), url = upload_image(img_data), update_sheet (wrap in try to skip on failure), emit if story_id, return url; except: logger.error and return None (to skip bad images).
In process_story_generation_with_scenes ( ~580): In the for loop, append img_url or "Skipped" if None, continue to videos.
Add log: After successful return, logger.info(f"Image {classifier} completed without approval").
Success Criteria: Submit storyâ€”logs show all 20 images processing/completing (no Telegram mentions/errors). Check browser: Images appear in grid via SSE (events in console).
Debug Tips: If still no images, check if emit_image_event logs "success" in flask_server.py. Use browser Network tab for SSE requests.
Goal 4: Fix Sheets Warnings with Fallbacks
Objective: Make Google Sheets optional, adding fallbacks so warnings don't affect image flow or future regeneration.
Rationale: Logs show sheets skippingâ€” this isn't blocking images now, but ensuring fallbacks prevents indirect issues (e.g., no prompt for regen).
Files to Edit: Animalchannel.py
Key Instructions:
Add flag at ~70: use_sheets = os.getenv("USE_GOOGLE_AUTH") == "true" and os.path.exists(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE) and sheets_service is not None.
In create_sheet/update_sheet ( ~100-130, ~460): Wrap API calls in if use_sheets: try: ... except: logger.warning("Sheets failed: {e}"); else: logger.info("Sheets unavailable - skipping"). For create_sheet, if skipped, set a default idea = "NoSheet_" + timestamp.
In process_image/update calls: Use the flag to skip silently.
For future regen (add placeholder): If not use_sheets, use a default prompt like "Default red fox image".
Success Criteria: Disable sheets (set USE_GOOGLE_AUTH=false in .env), submit storyâ€”logs warnings but all images complete/emitted. No new errors.
Debug Tips: Run with invalid SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILEâ€”confirm skips without crash.
Goal 5: Add Retry Logic for Image Generation Failures
Objective: Add retries in generate_image/upload to handle transient errors (e.g., DALL-E rate limits, network blips), ensuring more images complete.
Rationale: If non-Telegram errors occur (e.g., API timeouts), retries prevent early halts, increasing chances of full image set.
Files to Edit: Animalchannel.py
Key Instructions:
In generate_image ( ~330): Wrap asyncio.run(generate_async(prompt)) in a loop (max_retries=3): try: return ... except Exception as e: if retry < max, time.sleep(5 * retry), logger.warning(f"Retry {retry} for generate: {e}"); else raise.
In upload_image ( ~350): Similar retry loop around requests.post (handle ConnectionError/Timeout).
Update process_image to call these retry-enabled functions.
Success Criteria: Simulate a failure (e.g., temporarily invalidate OPENAI_API_KEY), submit storyâ€”logs show retries, and pipeline continues to next image.
Debug Tips: Add artificial delay/error in code for testing, then remove.
Phase 3: Verification and Frontend Display (Goals 6-8)
Ensure images display once generated.
Goal 6: Verify SSE Emits and Add Logging
Objective: Add logging in emit_image_event to confirm SSE works, and mock emits for testing.
Rationale: If images generate but don't show, SSE might fail (e.g., Redis config). This isolates backend-to-frontend issues.
Files to Edit: flask_server.py
Key Instructions:
In emit_image_event ( ~40): Add logger.debug before/after sse.publish (e.g., "Attempting emit for {scene_number}", "Emit success"). On except, log full traceback.
Add a test endpoint /test_emit/<story_id> ( ~280): Call emit_image_event with fake data, return "Test emitted".
Success Criteria: After Goal 3 fixes, submit storyâ€”logs show "Emit success" for all 20. Call /test_emit via browserâ€”check console for SSE event.
Debug Tips: In browser console, monitor EventSource connections. If no events, check if REDIS_URL is set in .env.
Goal 7: Enhance Frontend to Log SSE/Polling Events
Objective: Add debug logs in index.html for SSE/polling to confirm if events are received but not rendering.
Rationale: Your cursor at line 750 is in showCompletionMessageâ€”expand debugging here to see if 'image_ready' events arrive but displayImage fails.
Files to Edit: index.html
Key Instructions:
In startImageEventStream ( ~480): Add console.log('Received image_ready:', e.data) in the listener.
In handlePollingData ( ~570): Add console.log('Polling data:', data).
In displayImage ( ~600): Add console.log('Displaying image for scene', sceneNumber, 'URL:', imageUrl).
Set DEBUG_MODE = true at ~290 for more logs.
Success Criteria: Submit storyâ€”browser console shows "Received image_ready" for each, then "Displaying image". If logs appear but no UI update, issue in HTML rendering.
Debug Tips: Use browser Network tab > WS for SSE, or inspect #imageGrid element.
Goal 8: End-to-End Image Test and Cleanup
Objective: Run a full test, add a skip-Telegram env flag, and update CLAUDE.md with progress.
Rationale: Verify fixes work end-to-end, and add a toggle to disable Telegram without code changes.
Files to Edit: Animalchannel.py, CLAUDE.md
Key Instructions:
In Animalchannel.py (~30): Add ENABLE_TELEGRAM = os.getenv("ENABLE_TELEGRAM", "true") == "true". In process_image/process_video, wrap Telegram calls in if ENABLE_TELEGRAM: ... else: return True/None (auto-approve).
In CLAUDE.md, add a section: "Image Fixes Progress: Telegram removed, images now generate fully and display via SSE."
No other changesâ€”focus on testing.
Success Criteria: Set ENABLE_TELEGRAM=false in .env, submit storyâ€”all 20 images appear in frontend. Logs clean, no warnings except optional sheets.
Debug Tips: If still no images, share full logs and browser console output.
These goals should get images working reliably. Once done, move to regeneration/buttons (previous Pending Goals 3-7). For git push after:
