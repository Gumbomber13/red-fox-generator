## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Flask Server (`flask_server.py`)**
- REST API endpoints:
  - `/submit`: Generates and returns 20 story scenes (no image generation)
  - `/approve_scenes`: Starts background image generation process
  - `/stream`: Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time image updates
  - `/health`: Health check endpoint
  - `/story/<story_id>`: Polling endpoint for SSE fallback
- Session management via in-memory `active_stories` dict
- Uses multiprocessing for background story generation
- Flask-SSE with Redis support or in-memory fallback

**Story Generation Pipeline (`Animalchannel.py`)**
- Main functions: `process_story_generation()` and `process_story_generation_with_scenes()`
- Flow: Quiz answers → System prompt → OpenAI 20-scene generation → Visual prompt creation → Prompt standardization → Async DALL-E image generation → Cloudinary upload
- Optional integrations: Google Sheets tracking, video generation (Kling/Hailuo), Telegram approval (deprecated)
- Comprehensive logging throughout pipeline for debugging
- Async image generation using httpx for improved performance

**Frontend (`index.html`)**
- Single-page application with branching quiz logic
- Real-time image display with SSE connections and polling fallback
- 20 editable scene text boxes with auto-resize functionality
- Event handling for `image_ready`, `story_complete`, and `story_error`
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism for connection resilience

### Data Flow
1. User completes quiz in `index.html`
2. Form data sent to Flask `/submit` endpoint, returns generated scenes
3. Frontend displays scenes in editable text boxes with auto-resize
4. User modifies scenes and clicks "Approve Scenes" button
5. Approved scenes sent to `/approve_scenes`, returns `story_id`
6. Frontend opens SSE connection to `/stream?channel={story_id}`
7. Flask server launches multiprocessing `process_story_generation_with_scenes()`
8. Background process: Scenes → Visual prompts → Standardization → Async DALL-E generation → Cloudinary upload
9. SSE events emitted for each completed image with real-time updates
10. Frontend updates image grid in real-time or falls back to polling
11. Optional: Google Sheets tracking and Telegram approval (deprecated)
12. Optional: Final video generation via Kling/Hailuo APIs

### Key Integration Points
- **OpenAI**: Scene generation (GPT), visual prompt creation, image generation (DALL-E 3)
- **Cloudinary**: Image hosting and URL generation for frontend display
- **Flask-SSE + Redis**: Real-time event streaming with fallback to in-memory
- **Telegram**: Optional approval workflow for generated images (deprecated, disabled by default)
- **Google Sheets**: Optional prompt storage and progress tracking
- **Kling/Hailuo**: Optional video generation from final image sets

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Comprehensive logging throughout all pipeline stages
- Graceful fallback for optional services (Telegram, Google Sheets)
- SSE with exponential backoff retry and polling fallback
- Async image generation with proper error handling
- Environment variable validation with warnings
- Multiprocessing isolation prevents main server crashes

4. Rejected images automatically regenerate and re-emit as `pending_approval`
5. When all 20 images approved → "Generate Videos" button appears
6. User clicks "Generate Videos" to proceed to next phase

### Logging Examples:
```
[APPROVAL] Emitted pending_approval for image 1
[APPROVAL] Image 1 approved for story abc-123
[APPROVAL] Status: 19/20 images approved, 1 rejected
[APPROVAL] Triggering regeneration for rejected image 5
[APPROVAL] All images approved for story abc-123
[APPROVAL] Emitted all_approved event for story abc-123
```
