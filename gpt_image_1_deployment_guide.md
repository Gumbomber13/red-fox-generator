## Deployment Strategy

### Option A: Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Deploy to staging environment first**
2. **Test full workflow with real API calls**
3. **Validate image quality and performance**
4. **Switch production traffic to new version**
5. **Monitor for issues, rollback if needed**

### Option B: Feature Flag Deployment
1. **Add environment variable**: `USE_GPT_IMAGE_1=true/false`
2. **Deploy with feature flag disabled**
3. **Enable for percentage of users**
4. **Gradually increase percentage**
5. **Remove feature flag once stable**

### Option C: Direct Deployment (Current Approach)
1. **Deploy all changes at once**
2. **Monitor closely for first 24 hours**
3. **Have rollback plan ready**

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Verify environment setup
python -c "import os; print('OPENAI_API_KEY:', 'SET' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else 'MISSING')"

# Test GPT-Image-1 access (if API key is set)
python test_gpt_image_1.py

# Verify all files are updated
grep -r "dall-e-3" . --exclude-dir=.git
# Should only show documentation/comments, not active code
```

### 2. Deployment Commands
```bash
# For local development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate from DALL-E 3 to GPT-Image-1 for enhanced image quality

- Update model parameter to gpt-image-1
- Increase timeouts to 180s for longer processing time
- Update logging and comments to reflect GPT-Image-1
- Maintain existing rate limiting and error handling
- Add comprehensive test suite and quality validation"

# For production (Render/similar)
git push origin main
# Monitor deployment logs for successful startup
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Test image generation endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "validation"}'

# Monitor logs for GPT-Image-1 API calls
tail -f logs/animalchannel.log | grep "GPT-Image-1"
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Performance Metrics
- **Average generation time**: Should be 60-120s (vs 30-60s for DALL-E 3)
- **Success rate**: Target >98% (improvement from ~95%)
- **Timeout rate**: Should be <1% with 180s timeout
- **Concurrent processing**: Verify batch processing still works

#### Quality Metrics
- **User satisfaction**: Monitor approval rates
- **Regeneration requests**: Should decrease due to better quality
- **Error rates**: Watch for new error patterns
- **API rate limiting**: Ensure no 429 errors

#### System Metrics
- **Memory usage**: May increase slightly per request
- **CPU usage**: Should remain similar
- **Network bandwidth**: Potentially higher due to larger image files
- **Response times**: Monitor end-to-end user experience

### Alerting Thresholds
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Success rate < 90%
  - Average timeout rate > 5%
  - System memory > 90%
  - Error rate > 10%

Warning Alerts:
  - Success rate < 95%
  - Average generation time > 150s
  - Timeout rate > 2%
  - User satisfaction < 8.0
```

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# Quick revert to DALL-E 3
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# Or manual change:
# Change "gpt-image-1" back to "dall-e-3" in Animalchannel.py
# Change timeout back to 120.0
# Deploy immediately
```

### Rollback Indicators
- Success rate drops below 85%
- Timeout rate exceeds 10%
- User complaints about quality regression
- System performance degradation
- OpenAI API errors specific to GPT-Image-1

### Rollback Validation
```bash
# After rollback, verify DALL-E 3 is working
curl -X POST /test-generation
# Check logs show "DALL-E API completed"
# Verify normal performance metrics restored
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Model Access Denied
**Error**: `"Model gpt-image-1 not found"`
**Solution**: 
- Verify organization has GPT-Image-1 access
- Check API key permissions
- Contact OpenAI support for access verification

#### 2. Timeout Issues
**Error**: Requests timing out at 180s
**Solution**:
- Check OpenAI API status
- Verify network connectivity
- Consider increasing timeout to 240s temporarily
- Monitor for pattern in timeout prompts

#### 3. Quality Regression
**Issue**: Users reporting lower quality images
**Solution**:
- Compare sample outputs with DALL-E 3 baseline
- Review prompt optimization
- Check for prompt sanitization issues
- Gather specific user feedback

#### 4. Rate Limiting
**Error**: HTTP 429 "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**:
- Verify rate limiting logic still works with new processing times
- Check if batch processing timing needs adjustment
- Monitor concurrent request patterns
